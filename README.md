# UIDevice+SupportedDevices

### About
An Objective-C category on `UIDevice` that returns devices based on the supportedDevices key in the JSON results returned in an [iTunes Lookup API call](http://itunes.apple.com/lookup).

### Changelog (v0.0.4)
- All device names except for iPad Air and iPad Mini 2 have been added and verified.

### Installation Instructions

- Coming Soon.

### Inspiration
This category was born within [issue 35](https://github.com/ArtSabintsev/Harpy/issues/35) of the [Harpy](http://www.github.com/ArtSabintsev/Harpy) repository. The underlying idea and part of the research for building this category came from [Aaron Brager](http://www.github.com/getaaron).
